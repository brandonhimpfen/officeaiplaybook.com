## When to use

Use this before writing a report, briefing note, or internal memo. It’s a fast way to impose structure.
## Prompt

Paste your rough notes (sanitized if needed) and request an outline plus questions to confirm.

<div class="codebox">
  <div class="codebar">
    <strong style="font-size:13px;">Outline prompt</strong>
    <button class="btn" data-copy="#code-outline">Copy</button>
  </div>
  <pre id="code-outline">Create a report outline from these notes.

Rules:
- Do not invent facts.
- Keep headings descriptive.
- End with “Questions to confirm” if information is missing.

Output:
- Title
- Executive summary (3–5 bullets)
- Background
- Findings (grouped)
- Options (if applicable)
- Recommendation (if applicable)
- Appendix: source notes

NOTES:

</div>
## Next step

Draft one section at a time. Keep a “facts only” pass separate from “recommendation” wording.
