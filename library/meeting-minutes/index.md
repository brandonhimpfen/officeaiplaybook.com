## When to use
Use this right after a meeting while context is fresh. It’s best when decisions and action items matter.

## Prompt
Paste your notes (or a sanitized excerpt) and request structured minutes.

### Copy/paste
```
Turn these notes into meeting minutes with:

Sections:
- Summary (2–4 bullets)
- Decisions (bullet list)
- Action Items (owner + due date if stated; otherwise mark TBD)
- Open Questions (what’s unresolved)

Rules:
- Do not invent details.
- Keep wording neutral and clear.
- If something is unclear, ask a question rather than guessing.

NOTES:

```

## Quality checks
- Confirm decision wording with the meeting lead.
- Ensure each action item has one owner and a clear due date (or mark as TBD).
- Remove or generalize any sensitive details before sharing externally.
