## When to use

Use this right after a meeting while the context is fresh. It’s best when decisions and action items matter.
## Prompt

Paste your notes (or a sanitized excerpt) and request structured minutes.

<div class="codebox">
  <div class="codebar">
    <strong style="font-size:13px;">Minutes prompt</strong>
    <button class="btn" data-copy="#code-minutes">Copy</button>
  </div>
  <pre id="code-minutes">Turn these notes into meeting minutes with:
- Summary
- Decisions
- Action Items (owner + due date if stated)
- Open Questions

Rules:
- Do not invent details.
- Keep wording neutral and clear.

NOTES:

</div>
## Quality checks

Confirm decision wording with the meeting lead. Ensure action items have one owner and a clear due date (or mark as TBD).
