## What to remove

This is a practical boundary list. If your workplace has stricter rules, follow them.

<div class="codebox">
  <div class="codebar">
    <strong style="font-size:13px;">Redaction + safe summary template</strong>
    <button class="btn" data-copy="#code-redact">Copy</button>
  </div>
  <pre id="code-redact">Before using AI, remove or replace:
- Names, emails, phone numbers, addresses
- Client/patient identifiers and account numbers
- Internal IDs, credentials, tokens, secrets
- Confidential financials not meant for sharing
- Anything covered by policy or NDA

Then summarize like this:
Context (safe):
- [What this is]
Goal:
- [What you need]
Constraints:
- [Rules, deadlines, tone]
Input excerpt (sanitized):
- [Non-sensitive excerpt]</pre>
</div>
## A safer pattern

Instead of pasting the whole document, describe the goal and provide only the minimum sanitized excerpt needed.
