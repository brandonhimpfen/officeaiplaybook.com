## When to use

Use this for policies, memos, reports, or long threads when you want a clean summary without copying sensitive details.
## Prompt

Use the prompt below after sanitizing the text. The output includes a verification step.

<div class="codebox">
  <div class="codebar">
    <strong style="font-size:13px;">Safe summary prompt</strong>
    <button class="btn" data-copy="#code-safe-summary">Copy</button>
  </div>
  <pre id="code-safe-summary">Summarize this document safely.

Rules:
- Do not include identifiers, names, or sensitive details.
- If something is uncertain, say so.
- Output should be useful for a coworker who hasn't read it.

Provide:
1) 5-line overview
2) Key points (facts only)
3) Decisions / requirements (if present)
4) Risks / open questions
5) What I should verify

SANITIZED TEXT:
[PASTE HERE]</pre>
</div>
## Review step

Compare the summary against the original for nuance, especially around requirements and dates.
