## When to use

Use this when you already have a draft email but want it clearer, calmer, and more professional without changing the facts.

<div class="callout">If the email includes confidential details, sanitize before pasting. Keep names and identifiers out.</div>
## Prompt

Paste your draft and request two variants while flagging ambiguity.

<div class="codebox">
  <div class="codebar">
    <strong style="font-size:13px;">Email rewrite prompt</strong>
    <button class="btn" data-copy="#code-email">Copy</button>
  </div>
  <pre id="code-email">Rewrite this email in a warm, professional tone. Preserve facts and intent.

Output:
1) Concise version
2) More detailed version

Also:
- Flag ambiguity or missing info.
- Do not invent details or names.

## Review before sending

Confirm names, dates, amounts, and commitments. Make sure the tone fits your organization and recipient.
