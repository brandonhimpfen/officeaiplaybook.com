## When to use
Use this when you already have a draft email but want it clearer, calmer, and more professional without changing the facts.

## Prompt
Paste your draft (or a sanitized excerpt) and request two versions: one concise and one detailed.

### Copy/paste
```
You are helping me rewrite an email.

Goal:
- Make it warm-professional and clear.
- Preserve all facts and intent (do not add new information).
- Reduce ambiguity and remove emotionally loaded wording.
- Keep it short unless detail is necessary.

Output:
1) Concise version (best default)
2) Detailed version (adds context where helpful)
3) Any unclear points or missing info as questions (bullets)

Here is my draft:

```

## Quality checks
- Confirm names, dates, numbers, and commitments remain unchanged.
- Ensure the rewritten version does not introduce new claims.
- If anything is uncertain, ask a question instead of guessing.
