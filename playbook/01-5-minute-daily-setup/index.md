Most office workers don't need "AI skills."

They need a repeatable workflow that reduces mental load.

Here's a simple daily setup you can use that takes 5 minutes and makes the rest of the day smoother.

The goal is to start the day with clarity, priorities and ready-to-use templates.

**Important note:** never paste confidential or private information into AI tools. Use high-level summaries only.

## The 5-Minute Daily AI Setup

### Step 1 (60 seconds): Dump your context
Paste in:

- today's meetings (from calendar)
- sanitized urgent emails or threads (high-level summaries, no names or identifiers)
- tasks you already know you need to do

### Step 2 (60 seconds): Define the outcome
Tell AI what a "successful day" looks like for your role.

### Step 3 (60 seconds): Ask for priorities
Have AI rank what matters most, not what feels loudest.

### Step 4 (60 seconds): Identify risks
Ask: what could derail today?

### Step 5 (60 seconds): Generate quick drafts
Have it draft:

- 2 key emails (generic placeholders)
- 1 update message (Teams/Slack style)
- 1 short agenda for your first meeting

That's it.

Now your day isn't starting from scratch.

## Example
If your day looks busy, you'll write:

> "Help me plan today. Prioritize what I should do first, what I should defer and what I should delegate. Include draft replies for the two most important messages using placeholders only."

## Copy/Paste Prompt (Reusable Daily Prompt)

```text
You are my AI work assistant helping me plan my day.

I'm going to paste my schedule and key messages below.
NOTE: This content is sanitized. No confidential or identifying information is included.

Your job:
1) Identify my top 3 priorities for today (urgency + impact).
2) Identify what I should NOT do today (low value or deferrable tasks).
3) Flag any risks or bottlenecks that could derail my day.
4) Build a realistic time-block plan for the day.
5) Draft templates for 2 messages I need today:
 - one e-mail reply template (with placeholders).
 - one internal update (Teams/Slack style).

Constraints:
- Keep it practical.
- Assume I have limited time.
- Use placeholders like [Client], [File], [Deadline], [Team], [Decision].

Here is my schedule + context:
[PASTE HERE]
```

If you're using AI at work, this is the habit that gives you the biggest return.
